# Console-Finances

## Overview
This repository is the result of the Unit 4 Challenge: Console Finances. In this activity, I used my JavaScript skills to create code for analyzing the financial records of a company. The provided starter/index.js file contains the financial dataset that I worked with.

## Instructions

### Cloning the Repository
1. Initiated the process by creating a new GitHub repository named Console-Finances.
2. Cloned the repository to the local machine.
3. Integrated the starter files into the local git repository.

### Dataset Information
- The financial dataset is structured with arrays containing two fields: Date and Profit/Losses.

### Tasks Completed
Successfully executed the following tasks using JavaScript:

- Calculated the total number of months in the dataset.
- Determined the net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period.
- Calculated the average of the changes in Profit/Losses over the entire period.
- Identified the greatest increase in Profit/Losses (date and amount) over the entire period.
- Identified the greatest decrease in Profit/Losses (date and amount) over the entire period.

### Console Output
Upon running the code, the console output mirrors the following example:

```plaintext
Financial Analysis
----------------
Total Months: 86
Total: $38382578
Average Change: -2315.12
Greatest Increase in Profits/Losses: Feb-2012 ($1926159)
Greatest Decrease in Profits/Losses: Sep-2013 ($-2196167)
```

## Hints
I did some research on my own to tackle the challenges in this project.
I used string concatenation to combine strings and variables in the console.
I figured out how to format numbers to the nearest hundredth in JavaScript.

I am ready to submit the following for review:
