# Console-Finances


## Overview

This repository is the result of the Unit 4 Challenge: Console Finances. In this activity, I used my JavaScript skills to create code for analyzing the financial records of a company. The provided starter/index.js file contains the financial dataset that I worked with.


## Instructions


### Cloning the Repository

1. Initiated the process by creating a new GitHub repository named Console-Finances.
2. Cloned the repository to the local machine.
3. Integrated the starter files into the local git repository.


### Dataset Information

- The financial dataset is structured with arrays containing two fields: Date and Profit/Losses.


### Tasks Completed

Successfully executed the following tasks using JavaScript:

- Calculated the total number of months in the dataset.
- Determined the net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period.
- Calculated the average of the changes in Profit/Losses over the entire period.
- Identified the greatest increase in Profit/Losses (date and amount) over the entire period.
- Identified the greatest decrease in Profit/Losses (date and amount) over the entire period.


### Console Output

Upon running the code, the console output mirrors the following example:

```plaintext
Financial Analysis
----------------
Total Months: 86
Total: $38382578
Average Change: -2315.12
Greatest Increase in Profits/Losses: Feb-2012 ($1926159)
Greatest Decrease in Profits/Losses: Sep-2013 ($-2196167)
```
